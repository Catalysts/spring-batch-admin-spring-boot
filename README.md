spring-boot-admin-spring-boot
================================

This is a a Spring Boot capsule of the standard [Spring Batch Admin](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch-admin "Github") application of the [Spring Batch](http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/ "SpringIO Page") team. 

With this capsule it is possible to run the **Spring Batch Admin** as a **Spring Boot** application instead of deploying it to a servlet container like tomcat.

Feel free to use it. The current version of **Spring Batch Admin** can be modified in the pom.xml.
